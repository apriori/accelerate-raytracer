accelerate-raytracer
====================

A simple raytracer written in haskell accelerate EDSL
based upon https://gist.github.com/AdrianV/5774141, which is based upon http://forum.dlang.org/thread/yzsqwejxqlnzryhrkfuq@forum.dlang.org#post-yzsqwejxqlnzryhrkfuq:40forum.dlang.org

Dependencies are OpenGL, GLUT, repa, accelerate, accelerate-cuda

So far not everything is working properly and the rendered image only shows a single ray bounce.
